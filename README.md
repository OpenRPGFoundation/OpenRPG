The OpenRPG Project is an open source framework containing logic and templates designed to assist developers in creating RPG style video games. 

## About the Project

The idea for OpenRPG came from the frustrations that the creator, Matthew Norton, experienced working with game creation software such as RPGMaker. While these engines allow for rapid development of generic RPG games, they lack a simple and easy method to modify existing code to customize gameplay mechanics. The goal for the OpenRPG project is to provide a framework that is robust enough to create generic RPGs out-of-box but is still flexible and simple when creating custom game elements.
